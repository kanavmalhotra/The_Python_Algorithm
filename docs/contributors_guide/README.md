# Get you started with the TPA Development

This section of the documentation contains a guide for the users of the TPA project who wants to contribute code or documentation to our project. As a community, we share rules that abide with the good behaviour and interaction. Make sure you are familiar with the [community guidelines](https://github.com/the-python-algorithm/tpa/blob/dev/CONTRIBUTION.md) before continuing.

### How to use this guide

This guide attempts to explain how to use the TPA's development environment as precisely, 
predictably, and procedurally as possible.

Users who are new to the TPA's development should start by setting up their environment. Then, they should try a simple code change. After that, you should find something to work on or propose a totally new change. Even if you are a programming prodigy, you may still find this documentation useful.
